## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The non random variance are vihicle length (p=2.60e-12), ans ground clearance (p=5.21e-08).

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the of the model is non 0 as the significance levell of the intercept has a p value of 5.08e-08. 

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

THis linear mondel does predict the mpg of the protoypes well as the adjusted R-squared is 0.6825. A high R-square is associated with a good linear fit.
